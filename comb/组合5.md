## T1(*)(构造)

**来源[AIME1989T13](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4886_1989_aime_problems)**

Let $S$ be a subset of $\{1,2,3,\ldots,1989\}$ such that no two members of $S$differ by $4$or $7$. What is the largest number of elements  $S$ can have?

### solution

可推广至$n$。因为连续11个数只可能有5个属于$S$。并且具有周期性。



## T2

A class of fifteen boys and fifteen girls is seated around a round table. Their teacher wishes to pair up the students and hand out fifteen tests—one test to each pair.

As the teacher is preparing to select the pairs and hand out the tests, he wonders to himself, "How many seating arrangements would allow me to match up boy/girl pairs sitting next to each other without having to ask any student to change his or her seat?" Answer the teacher's question. (Two seating arrangements are regarded as being the same if one can be obtained from the other by a rotation.)

### solution

先配对再分配位置有$15!14!2^{15}$种但我们注意到这会产生重复，如旋转一下。

考虑分开计数，产生一次贡献为$x_1$，两次为$x_2$。

$x_2=15!14!$

再解即可。

Two squares on an 8 × 8 chessboard are called  *touching* if they have at least one common vertex.Determine  if it is possible for a king to begin in some square and visit all  the squares exactly once in such a way that all moves except the  first are made into squares touching an even number of squares  already visited.

接触点为奇数，但相邻为偶数，矛盾。
